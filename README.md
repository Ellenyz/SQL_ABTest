# SQL_ABTest
This is one of Ellen's 2021 course projects. 

The main objective of this project is to test whether a change in items' look on the website of an e-commerce company is a success.

(Changing the way the items look for some portion of items.)

Here's what I did:
* Identifying which metrics are relevant.
* Measuring “success” at an item level.

This project was fully completed on MODE.

Programming language: SQL + Python + https://thumbtack.github.io/abba/demo/abba.html
